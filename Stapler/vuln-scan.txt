|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.

|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2009-3103
|           Array index error in the SMBv2 protocol implementation in srv2.sys in Microsoft Windows Vista Gold, SP1, and SP2,
|           Windows Server 2008 Gold and SP2, and Windows 7 RC allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
|           denial of service (system crash) via an & (ampersand) character in a Process ID High header field in a NEGOTIATE
|           PROTOCOL REQUEST packet, which triggers an attempted dereference of an out-of-bounds memory location,
|           aka "SMBv2 Negotiation Vulnerability."

|       The service regsvc in Microsoft Windows 2000 systems is vulnerable to denial of service caused by a null deference
|       pointer. This script will crash the service if it is vulnerable. This vulnerability was discovered by Ron Bowes
|       while working on smb-enum-sessions.
